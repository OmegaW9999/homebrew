				"You summon a swirling cloud of silver dust in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and the dust clings to any creatures within the cloud. Each creature that enters the cloud or starts its turn within the cloud loses invisibility and become visible for the duration of the spell. ",
				"If a creature that is adversely affected by silver (such as a creature that has vulnerability to silvered weapons or loses its resistance to silvered weapons) enters the cloud or starts its turn within the cloud, it must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is {@condition stunned}. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, it is no longer {@condition stunned}."
